**Description about my project**

This project was madee by Sparsh Agarwal (12th A) which was based on automation, or to be more exact, _WhatsApp Automation_.

This application/software will take your inputs such as the contact of the person, the message you want to send and the time you want to send. Then, the contact number you have provided the message will be automatically send to the person at the specific time you've mentioned.

*Note : You must have WhatsApp Web signed in on your web browser otherwise this software is of no use.*

I have used two libraries in Python, *tkinter* library and *pywhatkit* library. Tkinter library is used to create interactive User Interface and Pywhatkit library is used to Automate WhatsApp. I have linked both the libraries to makeout the most out of them. 

I hope this software will help you to automate WhatsApp for a easy life.

Thank you
